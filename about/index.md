Hi there,

I hate writing, but at least it keeps me productive. Or precisely, it helps me to be distracted from other stuffs probably I'd like better when i have laptop in front of me.

So, I'm a grad student here in Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden. I'm pursuing Computer Systems and Networks master degree where I'm gonna focused my study on **Real-Time Systems**, **High Performance Computing**, and **Computer Security**. I have to say this path of life is sort of my escape. Back in 2011, I did some useful things (finally) by joining a very small lab working on stuffs and since then I felt I was in very good path. It is an irony, to think that one year before that I didn't think I could even graduate from my school. Blah!

So I create this blog just for fun. One sided model of reading materials. Nonetheless, I hope you can enjoy bad grammars that coming next.

I am a big fans of **James May** and Top Gear car entertainment TV show. Can't wait for the next release of episodes with Amazon! For now, just staring at the James' tweets all the time.

I love **Dota 2** and I'm avid fans of [Alliance Dota 2][1] team and they have their gaming house here in GÃ¶teborg! I played lot of games, spent too many times streaming games, watching pro players making money out of tournaments and I have to say, I enjoy those stuffs.

Enjoy this blog and leave a comment, will ya?
