Hi there,

![Göteborg & Chalmers]({{ site.url }}/images/post-chalmers3.jpg)
{: .image-pull-right}

I hate writing, but at least it keeps me productive. Or precisely, it helps me to be distracted from other stuffs probably i'd like better when i have laptop in front of me.

So, I'm a grad student here in Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden. I have to say this path of life is sort of my escape. Back in 2011, I did some useful things (finally) by joining a very small lab working on stuffs and since then I felt I was in very good path. It is an irony, to think that one year before that I didn't think I could even graduate from my school. Blah!

So I create this blog just for fun. One sided model of reading materials. Nonetheless, I hope you can enjoy bad grammars that coming next.

I love Dota 2 and I'm avid fans of [A]lliance Dota 2 team and they have their gaming house here in Göteborg! I played lot of games, spent too many times streaming games, watching pro players making money out of tournaments and I have to say, I enjoy those stuffs.

Enjoy this blog and leave a comment, will ya?
