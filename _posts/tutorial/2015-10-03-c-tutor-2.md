Wise and experienced programmers will always tell you this, *the only way to learn a programming language is to write programs*. It is true and I will just jumpstart by creating the very first simple C program. This program will simply prints some words, and play with how to bring the texts appear on the screen with `printf` function.

First thing to know is that, C-language are written in `.c` and `.h` file extensions. `.c` is the compile-able file that consist every functions and routines while `.h` is where you stores function names, variables, headers etc. You can live with `.c` alone but sometimes in order for programmer to be able to hide the intellectual property of, *e.g* the functions inside `.c`, programmers  merely write the function name inside `.h` and let the compiler transform `.c` with the definition of the function into either static or dynamic *library*. Thus, everyone who wants to use corresponding function, they will be provided by just the `.h` and the library, without requiring them to have the original `.c` code.

**line:01** demonstrates the use of a `#` preprocessor. A preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control. In many C implementations, it is a separate program invoked by the compiler as the first part of translation. [Check...][1]

Preprocessor is a separate step in the compilation process, thus is not part of the compiler. If you invoke a preprocessor in C, it will substitute the text with the one that is referred by the preprocessor, whether it is a macro function or a file header. Here a list of preprocessor that will be used frequently on this tutorial.

{% highlight java ruby %}
#define 	/* substitutes a preprocessor macro */
#include 	/* inserts a particular header from file */
#if 		/* test if a compile time condition is satisfied (true) */
#else 		/* alternative branch if #if does not satisfied the condition */
#endif 		/* end preprocessor conditional */
{% endhighlight %}

**line:03** is where you can find the first function called `main`. A bracket `()` after the function name collects the argument. Empty bracket means no argument passed onto the function.

**line:04** and **line:08** contain the function braces `{}`. Statements of a function are enclosed in braces. `{` begins the statements and `}` ends the statements.

**line:05** shows the invocation of function `printf` and an argument `"Hi, world\n"`. This function is called from the library `stdio.h` that is described from **line:01**. `printf` prints output to the screen, in this case, strings from our argument between quotes `" "`. `\n` tells `printf` to give a newline after printing the argument.

**line:07** with `return` statement terminates the execution. However, as the name implies, `return` gives certain value back to the calling function. If you call a function A within function `main`, and you invoke `return value` from within A, then `main` will get the value that computed inside A. More detailed about return statement can be found on [Wiki][2] page.

Next, we will go through the basic compilation using command line with `gcc`.
