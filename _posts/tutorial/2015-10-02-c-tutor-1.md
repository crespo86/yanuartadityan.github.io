Probably, you will see C-language as nothing special. You might even say C sucks compared to Java, Ruby or Python nowadays. But, is it? Well, if you start coding from 90s, probably you've encountered a hard time developing with `Fortran`, or `Assembly` and C came as a saviour from the darkness, it's like a [programming heaven][1].

There are several top reasons why C is still a good language to learn, here I've compiled some.

### **1. C has nice syntax**

As a language that often interacts with the `machine`, C is considered to be a *pretty* language with beautiful syntax.

{% highlight c linenos %}

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hi World\n");
  
  return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

As we can see, `Pygments` rendered C-syntax (with line numbers) beautifully. Now, time for a trivia. Can you guess, how many programmers which are saved by C-syntax from obfuscating codes? Count me one!

### **2. C macros are the best**

Macros is one of the most important preprocessor `#` implementation in C. It can be used to create a fast function without putting everything on the stack. Check this out,

{% highlight c linenos %}

#include <stdio.h>

/* preprocessor for a logical OR */
#define MACRO_OR(a, b) (a || b)

int main()
{
	bool a = true;
	bool b = false;

	/* invoke the MACRO_OR */
	bool c = MACRO_OR(a, b);

	return0;
}


{% endhighlight %}

In **line:4**, we define the macro function `MACRO_OR` that takes *a* and *b* as an input. Then, this macro will return the logical `OR` result from *a* and *b*. Super neat!

In **line:12**, the macro is invoked to compute the logical `OR` between *a* and *b* and return the result to *c*.


### **3. C is small**

C utilised merely variables, macros, functions and structures. Therefore, C is considered small in size, complexity and that much of it. Due to this, C has been heavily used on embedded system, modern microprocessor, even modern `Arduino`.

More about this, lot of parallel programming languages, OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA, etc, are based on C language due to its relative connection to lower level hardware compared with other languages.


### **4. C is root of all goodness**

You can pretty much stand on opinion that C is different compared to *C++* or *ObjectiveC*, but from pedagogical approach, lot of programming expert will tell you to learn basic things from C, e.g. *overflow*, *memory addressing*, *pointer*, *profiling* and *debugging*. A true concept of those languages can be learned from C.

### **5. C is still alive and sound**

The number one reason C is the best programming language today is still the fact that it simply powers everything. From your phone to your `Wii`, no other language provides the level of hardware interaction with the practicality of a concise and expressive syntax. Unless you’re still using an early `IBM` (please switch soon, if so), the screen you’re reading this article on is probably powered by C.

With C, we can forget writing thousands of complex *Assembly* routines, thousands of processor-specific instructions, and spaghetti like code. Because of C, the CPU, memory, and graphics cards have turned from their messy, low-level pasts into an easier, readable format
