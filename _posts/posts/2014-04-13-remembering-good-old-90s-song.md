I don&#8217;t know, but for me, I really hate MTV for now. I&#8217;m willing to put it onto bottom three of &#8216;channels I&#8217;ll never watch again&#8217; after MTV and MTV. I see how they&#8217;re trying to gather younger audiences by delivering some of the worst songs I&#8217;ve ever listen and, well, I&#8217;ve pretty much given up to love it once again.

Well, they used to be my favorite channel. That was back in 1998, I was 10 years old, I was in mad love with 98 World Cup theme, &#8216;Chumbawamba &#8211; Tubthumping&#8217;. I was really thankful that MTV aired this song more than twice in a day.

And it was going better and better, especially when my sister bought me MTV Fresh album in 1999. That was my first CD cassette. I can still remember properly the entire list:

> SIDE A

*   Arkarna &#8211; So Little Time
*   Chumbawamba &#8211; Tubthumping
*   Blur &#8211; Song 2
*   Green Day &#8211; Hitchin&#8217; a Ride
*   Third Eye Blind &#8211; Semi Charmed Life
*   Catatonia &#8211; Mulder & Scully
*   The Verve &#8211; The Drugs Don&#8217;t Work
*   Cornershop &#8211; Brime of Asha

> SIDE B

*   Everclear &#8211; Everything to Everyone
*   Meredith Brooks &#8211; Bitch
*   Mansun &#8211; Wide Open Space
*   Radiohead &#8211; Karma Police
*   Suede &#8211; Beautiful Ones
*   Matchbox Twenty &#8211; Push
*   Oasis &#8211; D&#8217;you Know What I Mean
*   Sugar Ray &#8211; Every Morning

Maybe if you&#8217;re lucky enough, you can find the list on <a title="Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube </a>or <a title="SoundCloud" href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>. But remember, 90s is just too good to be forgotten.
So MTV, will you learn from it? I don&#8217;t think you will.
Cheers!
