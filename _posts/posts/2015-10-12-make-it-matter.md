### Introduction

Back to 2 years ago, I have to be honest, I didn't have any idea what **Spotify** is. What kind of Android app it can do and I didn't have a chance to install it since there was no Spotify service in Indonesia. 

Year later, when I forgot completely about Spotify, I decide to pursue further study (master) in Sweden. People (friends, colleagues) are going for Australia (mostly), Singapore or Japan. Some are landing in Germany, Netherlands or UK. Some of the smartest are in States. Yet, no one opted for Sweden. 

I searched the internet and I've found Spotify again! Going deep into the darkest part of the internet looking for a motivation and here I am, in Sweden, getting closer to a company who single-handedly shown a new way how music should be distributed. I've [read][2] here that as a new artist, being discovered by Spotify doesn't necessarily help them to get a money, however, as an artist, being listened for your work deemed as more important IMHO, and somewhat Spotify takes a big role here.

Another breakthrough thing from Spotify is, with more than [20 million][1] songs in the library, sure it needs a lot of effort to put which songs on which categories but it seems like Spotify has succesfully done it, generating plenty of different playlist that we can pick and listen. It saves us lot of time, especially for someone who love to listen new songs everyday. Pick suitable mood in the playlist and let Spotify decides what's the best.

### Things I've Done

I am pursuing Computer Systems and Networks master programme in Chalmers University of Technology where I put more emphasizes about real-time systems, vehicular communications, software development & computer security. I am in second year now and ready for thesis by the end of this year. 

By this August, I was appointed to become one of the student ambassador in the university to help them promoting Chalmers abroad, especially Indonesia. I would like to carry Spotify name, alongside with other Swedish multinational company, *e.g.*, Volvo, Ericsson, Scania, SKF, DICE, etc. However, I don't feel that I'm good enough since I never really involved directly with Spotify, other than just a member and spending a night on [Study Night with Spotify][3] last year.
