### Introduction

Who hasn't heard about Spotify? Me...

Back to 2 years ago, I have to be honest, I didn't have any idea what **Spotify** is. What kind of iOS/Android app it can do and I didn't have a chance to install it since there was no Spotify service in Indonesia. 

Year later, when I completely forgot about Spotify, I decide to pursue master study in Sweden. People (friends, colleagues) are going for Australia (mostly), Singapore or Japan. Some landed in Germany, Netherlands or UK. Some of the smartest are in States. Yet, no one opted for Sweden. 

I searched the internet and I've found Spotify again! Going deep into the darkest part of the internet looking for an answer and here I am, in Sweden, getting closer to a company who single-handedly shown a new way how music should be distributed. This is exactly what you should do to avoid nasty piracy, especially in Indonesia, but why it's not available at that moment?

I've read [here][2] that as a new artist, being discovered by Spotify doesn't necessarily help them to get a money. However, as an artist, being listened for your works deemed as more important, and in my opinion, Spotify takes a big role here.

Another breakthrough thing from Spotify is, with more than [20 million][1] songs in the library, sure it needs a lot of effort to put which songs on which categories but it seems like Spotify has succesfully done it, generating plenty of different playlist that we can pick and listen. It saves us lot of time, especially for someone who love to listen new songs everyday. Pick suitable mood in the playlist and let Spotify decides what's the best. I can't really imagine if I have 20 million of songs in my drive, whenever I'm opening the music player, probably I will just listen to not more than 30 song titles. But now, with Spotify I did listen to much more songs than ever. I've discovered more and more good songs.

### Things I've Done

My name is Yanuar Tri Aditya Nugraha. I was born 27 years ago in small city in Java, Indonesia. I have a bachelor degree in electrical engineering and now I am pursuing Computer Systems and Networks master programme in Chalmers University of Technology where I put more emphasizes about real-time systems, vehicular communications and computer security. I am in second year now and ready for thesis by the end of this year. 

I have quite lot of experiences working on agile development. It was ~2 years working experience with software-defined radio for LTE 4G. It was a project funded by Indonesian government to accelerate the implementation of this technology. In sort, I was working with C-programming languages and MATLAB to derive embedded-system-friendly algorithms, *e.g.* cyclic redundancy check, fast fourier-transform, and turbo code.

Another project was with Microsoft, developing real-time melting effect on liquid simulations. Together as a three, we were given an existing real-time fluid simulation based on [this][kelager] and [that][amada] that use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics on Lagrangian fluid model. Then each of us had to pick certain scenario that can be developed and later on represented as a new validated (subjectively) results. I picked a scenario where thermodynamics is introduced to the system. It brings whole level of complexity as in fluid dynamics, as thermodynamics are applied, whole fluids behaviour, *e.g*, viscosity, density, friction, surface tension etc, are altered. However, by limiting the changing parameters with just viscosity and density, was considered enough to give a representative results.

This is one of the result that I've posted on my [Youtube][yt] channel.

Not that much of something you have expected to see, but I am open for new stuffs and new experiences. 

By this August, I was appointed to become one of the student ambassador in the university to help them promoting Chalmers abroad, especially Indonesia. I would like to carry Spotify name, alongside with other Swedish multinational companies, *e.g.*, Volvo, Ericsson, Scania, SKF, DICE, etc. However, I don't feel that I'm good enough since I never really involved directly with Spotify, other than just a member and spending a night on [Study Night with Spotify][spot] last year. Somehow I want to contribute more than that.

### Make IT Matter

I got the information what I need about this **Make IT Matter** event from Facebook. In a glimpse, with 3D2N format, it's like a hackathon for me. And talking about hackathon, I'm not exactly sure whether I can contribute or not in a team, as I consider myself not really a software developer who has broad knowledge on software development tools, I do know some of JavaScript library, e.g. **D3.js** for data-driven visualisation, but my most used experience is in C language though. I don't know if that will gonna be a big help. Probably that's not a technical knowledge that will be needed much in a software company like Spotify, but I do love to have an opportunity to meet people all around the world in this event.

Getting to know with what's gonna happen in the near future, especially if the news comes within one of the most successful software company who [engineered the new music industry][mash] will definitely something to look up to. I would love to be inside the event with Spotify.

Thanks a lot and warm regards,
