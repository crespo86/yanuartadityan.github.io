Is `CPU` the whole computers? Or just a jargon for processor? 
Is by clicking `refresh` button rapidly will make your system faster? 
Is it correct, more `GHz` will always give you faster overall performance?
Which one is to use, `byte` or `bit`?
How `RAM` works similar as compared in an analogy to the famous librarian?

All of those questions are quite common to be found almost anywhere. I thought at first, those are misconceptions about computer that will not happen when I am in Sweden. A friend of mine told me when he brought his broken PC to one of the electronic retail store here to let them fix it, when he told me he heard the IT-guy said,

> "Allright, we will try to fix your CPU as soon as possible. I'll let you know afterward."

Well, how many people consider CPU as a whole computer? Probably most of you are doing this all the time. Sometimes, I do too. Even, this misconception has occurred since long time ago and I think, even for IT-guy, it is better for him to use it as if he mentioned something technically correct, *e.g* desktop or machine, will be deemed too uncommon for most of people.

In one of opportunities to talk in front of people, I brought this misconceptions material. I've compiled some quite common misconceptions, especially about basic computer organizations and explain more about how computer do this and that to give audience better understanding about how computer works.

You see, now there are more computers than world's population. By bringing this fact, I would like to stand on my opinion that humans, no matter what background we are, we will encounter computers anywhere and anytime. Yeah, they don't have soul, but people made computers not just to help us, but if we think, without computers, we couldn't as efficient as today. We couldn't talk to relatives thousand miles away, we couldn't share what inside our heads, i couldn't write things like this and you're reading it now.

Cheers and tack s√• mycket!
