Allright, now we're in December. And Sweden is a land of OCD! Well, I mean OCD in a good way. Christmas mood starts at the end of November and that's pretty early I must say. People are setting up their red coloured candles anywhere, light bulbs and obviously, Christmas Tree. Well, I don't care at all about all of this. It just feels that I feel people are so motivated by the this *Jul*, or Christmas, or Natal, or the-birth-of-Jesus.

Anyway, I do not celebrate Christmas, and I will have full 3 weeks of holiday before exams starting next week. And 3 weeks is quite long I believe. Thus, I'm going to Iceland before Christmas and I'm planning to stay two days in Copenhagen right after it. And while I am so excited to go there, I feel there is something wrong with this trip. I don't know why, but I feel that we're gonna to Iceland, land of northern wild, land where ice and fire meet. A land so wild for a regular ordinary tropical dude like me and without that much of preparation...and money. It's just I'm afraid I can't visit every place on my stay there, e.g. volcano, glacier walk, chasing northern light, literally hot river, blue lagoon, and much more.

That's a long list but not quite detailed. Anyway, for the whole week of vacation, we will spend approximately 5000 SEK. Not cheap but I hope it will worth it. So, see you in Iceland!
