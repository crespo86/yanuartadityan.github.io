This is my last week on Jakarta and I have to say, I am really `grateful` about it. Why? For the last 6 months, you can consider me as one amongst thousands of motorist trapped on `deadlock traffic` as shown on above image.

I was working on Sudirman, quite busy office district in Center &#8211; South Jakarta border which is merely ~10 mins walk to Bunderan HI, a famous landmark of Jakarta. However, my home is `26 kilometres` away.

Technically, if you ride anything which resulted on average 26 km per hour of speed, you will spend an hour on the road. However, that&#8217;s not really true on the practice. My record was 3 and half hours for only 26 km of distance. Which means, LESS than third of average speed. For 3.5 hours, I need to battle hot weather, sweat, CO2 smoke and `emotional feeling` by understanding that you will go nowhere in a minute or two.

I have a brother who can considered as an avid motorist. He drove his motor to his office `since 2001`. He said that Jakarta in 2001 was really empty. Same distance covered only in 25 to 30 minutes, less fatigue and less chance to be `killed` on duty. However, urbanisation to Jakarta is `uncontrollable` and people start their family outside the Jakarta, e.g. Tangerang, Bekasi, Depok even Bogor. `Slow commuter` and `not enough` Busway corridor motivate people to buy `cheaper-than-ever` motor and start to be a motorist. Plus, it was very easy to get a driving license at that time caused everyone to officially eligible to ride motor every day every night.

Well, traffic is a sign of a `ache` or `disease` of a city. If that&#8217;s true (you have to agree with me on this), then Jakarta only have couple of days to live from this disease. That&#8217;s my opinion on how bad, how monstrous traffic in Jakarta can be.
