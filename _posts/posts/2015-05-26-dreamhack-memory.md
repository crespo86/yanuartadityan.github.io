Last year November, I was in Dreamhack Winter 2014, Jönkoping. I was there with three friends of mine. David & Sushil, both are my classmates and avid Dota 2 fans (same with me), and Raymond. Raymond is from States and prolific Hearthstone player.

We left Göteborg at Saturday while Dreamhack took place since Wednesday. It was quite cold but there was no sign of snow coming in. I still remember when we arrived at Jönkoping Bus Terminal, we encountered several gamers sleeping in the terminal with their PCs inside their sleeping bag. Duh, those guys need some serious sleep after days of sleepless gaming I suppose.

WE ARE IN DREAMHACK DUDE!

I don't know but Dreamhack is something very special to me. I know Dreamhack since 2004 when I played World of Warcraft III for the first time. I know there was Starcraft back then that's quite popular on some unknown event called Dreamhack. But I know that it is a serious stuff 3 years later when I was in 2nd year on college. I started to play Dota and with generous help from so-thing-called Internet, I've found what I need about Dreamhack.

Back then I've put Dreamhack into my bucket list of place I must visit once in my life and in 2014, I was in Dream-come-true-Hack 2014! LIVE from Sweden! I met several pro players of Dota 2 and casters, e.g. whole Evil Geniuses, Cloud Nine, Virtus Pro, Sheever, LD, SingSing and not to mention [A] legends, Lod[A] and [A]kke.

Can't wait for this year Dreamhack Winter again to visit!
