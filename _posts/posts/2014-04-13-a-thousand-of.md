  After having 12 days of leadership oriented training held by LPDP Scholarship, which half of them spent on outdoor (Halim Perdanakusumah Military Airfield and Mount Salak mountainside), maybe that quote from the very first prominent president of Indonesia just feels right.
</p>

As a young generation, we were doctrined and visioned as a potential ruler and leader at the time of 100th Anniversary of Indonesia in 2045. But, was it worth to spent 12 days just to tell us that? Was it efficient enough? I&#8217;d rather eat hell lot of quotes from Ir. Soekarno and done with it. Maybe it just takes you a whole day to learn to understand what it feels like to be a leader of a nation.<!--more-->

However, I have to be honest now and those days were absolutely unforgettable. I was in tears when we were having &#8216;failed&#8217; closing night bonfire party at airfield. Those armies were still trying so hard to make a fire out of watery-wood and when I start to realize that they are the frontier of sovereignty, they are the last people who stand when we, poor citizens, losing hope easily because of conflict, war and disaster. I immediately started to cry and tried so hard to hid it.

Oh, why didn&#8217;t we just learn to live like they were doing, not for only 3 days, but hundred of days. Believe me, I can live with them for couple of years. I should say let&#8217;s do a mandatory military service for every young generations. 1 year is OK, 2 years is perfect. Let&#8217;s make those armies shout and yell at us, because I love it. I love to be shouted, by the frontier of sovereignty. But no ass-spanking. Hey ho!?

Lastly, those 3 days was a happy moment for them, they were so proud about Indonesia, and I thought that was good for them. They need sympathy from all of us. They need to be acknowledged. Well, some of them are jackass for sure, but maybe because I was jealous when they got attention easily from the girls. LOL. Well, well done sir, you deserve that. Maybe&#8230;.just maybe.

Looking forward to meet those guys again anytime soon. Sukhoi!?

Cheers.
