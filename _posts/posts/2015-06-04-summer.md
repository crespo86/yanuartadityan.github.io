### Season in Gothenburg

If we talk about season in western archipelago of Sweden, then Gothenburg, so to speak, is representing what you may call unforeseen forecasted weather. It is May already, several parts of Europe already bathing in 20-hours of sunlight, pretty close to body temperature warmth that attracts Summer's Mood of everyone to come out. However, it is still 10 Degree Celcius here in Gothenburg. Valkommn till Sverige!

### So, What's Next?

Prepare for the worst. It's a routine to check today's weather before you leave home. Always make sure to dress properly and do not forget to bring your worst case suit all the time. I do prefer wearing my trusty waterproof hardshell everytime anytime, probably with fleece and a shirt. Always come with spare of shirts and socks on the backpack.

### Killing Time

The weather can change quickly. Always think positive, if you don't wanna get *jinxed*. When the weather is good, just enjoy. Do not think about probability of raining or cloud will come in a glimpse of your eye.

### So What?

Sweden is pretty country. Gothenburg itself is amazing. Fantastic public transportation, superb education and industry, big port and ships and the weather as well. So, please come and enjoy Gothenburg.
