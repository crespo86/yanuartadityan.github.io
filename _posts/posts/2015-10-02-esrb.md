Allright, so let's start with several questions now.

* How **often** you've played video games?

* How many people you think have spent **4 hours a day** to play video games?

* How parents can be rest assured that their kids are playing **proper video games**?

Video games industry now has shifted towards digital distribution instead of good old CDs or DVDs. When now people are having a hard time checking whether their video games are good or not for kids, internet helps significantly this industry penetration to almost every consumer ages. With availability of mobile phones and tablets, kids everywhere are prone to the potential danger of video game addiction.

At one event, in front of general audience I've presented this problem to let them know about this growing issue. I hope this presentation will help you realize about this circumstance and give you a better insight on how to mitigate the situation for you, your kids, and your family.
