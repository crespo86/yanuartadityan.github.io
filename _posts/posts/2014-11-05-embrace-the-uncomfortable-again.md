Alright, if you do Google Image for `embrace`, then I'm quite sure it will turn you on. Yes, it will. Lot of hugs and kisses. Yeah, the definition of embrace is 'holding somebody closely in your arms'. Then `embrace the uncomfortable` is trying to hold and live closely with your uncomfortable sides. I know you have one or twos, I know we have it.

I ain't a programmer, just happens to be able to finish some stuffs with programming. Yet, programming, similar with other occupations, is kinda boring if you feel that you start to get stuck. So, what ordinary programmers secret to prevent this? The answer is embrace something you are unconfident, you are weak on them, you are ugly on them and everything you are certainly uncomfortable. Yeah, lot of Google queries about how this approach can become a really great solution to cherish your daily lives. 

For a reason which I don't really know, I get easily bored, even when I'm doing something really fun, e.g. `gaming`, `movie`, `book` etc. Even, for some people, to fulfil their nasty desire, they're willing to invest a lot of money in which they never used it after the momentum is gone. I'll take myself for an example. I love to play game and I want to do game properly. I bought my own games and spent not cheap money for that since 2009. Yet, only 15% of them which I've played, and rest of them I didn't even try to install it. Then, I'm trying to follow the waves and bought myself a big camera. Yet, `seldom` is how frequent I am using that gear. Thus, what then? New hobby didn't work out, so how I should tackle this bland routine and get some fun out of the moments?

The answer is my friend, one of the best answers is to `embrace` it, like I said twice or thrice before. If `excitement` is the thing you're looking for, then it is my best approach. How we should do this? To make it short, I will just use three simple steps,

1. Start exploring yourself, from top of your head to your toes.
2. Find what kind of weakness do you have, in which, there are few folks out there that good at it. Best words for this, find your `limitation`. Improve the threshold and work on it!
3. Try to match them!

For example,

1. I've done, I'm doing and always do a lot of typing.
2. Yet, I realize that I'm just using 5 fingers from 10 possibilities. Then I realize that there's a lot of people out there that can type flawlesly using 10 fingers.
3. I'm trying to match them, kinda killing me all the time, but it is a nice flavour addition to my life. And for a bonus, now I can type faster and more efficient.

Another example, this is my friend's,
	
1. He realized that he is having a hard time talking to a stranger.
2. Found a goals, in which, he has to talk to 5 strangers in a day.
3. Now, he's a king of pickup around here.

I know those examples are too specific and not so common, but you can always start with something that really simple,

* Arrange your schedule, so that you can go analog once in a week for entire day. Without your laptop, without your phones, no chargers, no internet. Just social!
* I know you are pretty bad with drawings LOL, start drawing back what you can remember from your first drawing in kindergarten and compare, which one is prettier? Kid-version of yours or present?
* If you're wearing glasses, try to walk carefully around your area without it. 
* If reading books is to common, then try to read something really nonsense, e.g. scientific journals and papers.

I know that it is more like a trivial steps on how to fight your limitation, but at least it gives me a `variation` that I need to keep my day cherished. Lot of things you can harvest from doing those silly stuffs. Believe me. It is nonsense at start, then you will realize that world is too big to be left doing nothing. Start from now my friends.
