Yeah, I just roamed through some JavaScript tutorial when I've found out about this thing called [RevolverMap][1]. It collects the visitor of your site and showing it with cool **GL** based 2D/3D globe as a widget on your site. It is free of charge, very easy to install and customisable in size and appearance. 

Here I'll try to provide you with some of the widges in action.

### Regular Globe

<script type="text/javascript" src="//ra.revolvermaps.com/0/0/6.js?i=0314opn7pot&amp;m=7&amp;s=341&amp;c=ff0000&amp;cr1=ffffff&amp;f=ubuntu&amp;l=0&amp;bv=100&amp;lx=-700&amp;ly=-320&amp;hi=40&amp;rs=100&amp;as=10" async="async"></script>

The regular globe is the latest one and the most updated I presume. You can attach the widget as new stuff or as an update to your previous attached widget. This is my favourite for now.

### Mini Globe

They also offer the regular globe but on smaller size. Probably it is a good widget for your multiple column sites. I'm thinking to put this mini globe right at the footer (think think think...).

<script type="text/javascript" src="//ra.revolvermaps.com/0/0/5.js?i=0g90dd9kyof&amp;m=1c&amp;s=180&amp;c=ff0000&amp;cr1=ffffff&amp;cw=ffffff&amp;cb=000000" async="async"></script>

### 2D Map

If you don't like a round globe, then probably a flat world map suits you better. It does come with several options for the map, *e.g.*, different seasons setup, transparent, and regular. Check the website for complete features.

<script type="text/javascript" src="//ra.revolvermaps.com/0/0/7.js?i=0tgvdwyy5bw&amp;m=6&amp;c=ff0000&amp;cr1=ffffff&amp;sx=0" async="async"></script>

Pretty cool huh? Try to customise everything by yourself, from color, transparency, background, size and how you can embed the widget on your website.

Cheers!
